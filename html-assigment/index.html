        <p>Hello my name is <strong>Misael</strong>, a.k.a <abbr title="Always Srive And Prosper"> ASAP </abbr>MiZZ I'm from mexico city </p> 
        And this is one of my first websites in the program of <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. Back in mexico I studied architecture, because architecture always been something that I feel connected with. I believe that a good architecture can influent into your humor and mindset, so I used take inspiration from people like TADAO ANDO and LUIS BARRAGAN.
        <p>
            I am 25 years old, sometimes I’m not going to lie, I feel kind of old, but like Pharrell say “It’s never too late to learn, you’re never too old to keep learning.”I like everything that is related to art and digital stuff, like this class.Also, I like the music, and I like to share and discover music of any type of genre.Curiosity is another thing that I always like, and I encourage in myself, I have this vision that makes the people nerd looks the real rockstars in the game.
        </p>
