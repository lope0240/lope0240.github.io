        <p>Hello digital world my name is Fernando but I prefer my middle name <strong>Misael</strong> also my name some
            of my friends call me <abbr title="Always Strive and Prosper">ASAP</abbr>MIZZ I'm from mexico city</p>
        And this is one of my first websites in the program of <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> in the
        Algonquin College. Back in Mexico, I studied Architecture for two primary reasons. First, I am fascinated by how
        light and space dictate human emotion and mood. Second, I am drawn to the permanence of architecture—the idea
        that a structure can outlast its creator, serving as a tangible, material legacy.

        <p>
            My work is deeply influenced by <a href="https://tadaoandoo.tilda.ws/" target="_blank">Tadao Ando</a> and
            <a href="https://www.casaluisbarragan.org/eng/en_luisbarragan.html" target="_blank">Luis Barragán</a>,
            specifically in how they masterfully manipulate natural light.

            On a personal note, my ADHD makes me naturally hyperactive. While this can sometimes be a challenge, it is
            also
            my greatest asset: it fuels an insatiable curiosity and a drive to learn. I am passionate about the
            intersection
            of art and digital technology, believing that when these two worlds collide, they can create something truly
            transformative for my generation and for humanity.

            <p>The architect need to learn to see, and to open his eyes because there is always a lesson to learn form
                the streets.</p>
